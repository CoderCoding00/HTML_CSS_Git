## Project Description

- "On the job ticket" given the started code that needs to be modified. 
- Refactored the given HTML and CSS code to be optimized for accessibility. 
- Ensured people with disabilities can access the website using assitive technologies. 
- Made the CSS more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements. 
- Replaced HTML element "div' to sematic element "header"
- Replaced "div" to "nav" for the unordered lists.
- Replaced individual section classes to class "section-type" since they all had the same styling applied to them.
